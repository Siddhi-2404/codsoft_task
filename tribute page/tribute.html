            <p>[Shivaji (born February 19, 1630, or April 1627, Shivner, Poona [now Pune], India—died April 3, 1680, Raigad) opposed the Mughal dynasty and founded the Maratha kingdom in 17th-century India. His kingdom’s security was based on religious toleration and on the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus. Shivaji was descended from a line of prominent nobles. India at the time of his birth, in 1630, was under Muslim rule: the Mughals in the north and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur and Golconda in the south. All three ruled by right of conquest, with no pretense that they had any obligations toward those who they ruled. Shivaji, whose ancestral estates were situated in the Deccan, in the realm of the Bijapur sultans, found the Muslim oppression and religious persecution of the Hindus so intolerable that, by the time he was 16, he convinced himself that he was the divinely appointed instrument of the cause of Hindu freedom—a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his life.Collecting a band of followers, he began about 1655 to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts. In the process, he destroyed a few of his influential coreligionists, who had aligned themselves with the sultans. All the same, his daring and military skill, combined with his sternness toward the oppressors of the Hindus, won him much admiration. His depredations grew increasingly audacious, and he overcame the minor expeditions sent against him.]</p><br>
             <p>Challenging the Mughals:

When the sultan of Bijapur in 1659 sent an army of 20,000 under Afzal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji, pretending to be intimidated, enticed the force deep into difficult mountain terrain and then killed Afzal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured him by submissive appeals. Meanwhile, handpicked troops that had been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and routed it. Overnight, Shivaji had become a formidable warlord, possessing the horses, the guns, and the ammunition of the Bijapur army.

Alarmed by Shivaji’s rising strength, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered his viceroy of the south to march against him. Shivaji countered by carrying out a daring midnight raid right within the viceroy’s encampment. The viceroy lost the fingers of one hand and his son was killed, which prompted him to withdraw his force. Shivaji, as though to provoke the Mughals further, sacked the rich coastal town of Surat.

Aurangzeb could hardly ignore such a challenge and sent out his most prominent general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh, at the head of a vast army, said to number some 100,000 men. Shivaji was compelled to sue for peace and to agree that he and his son would attend Aurangzeb’s court at Agra in order to be formally accepted as Mughal vassals. In Agra, hundreds of miles from their homeland, Shivaji and his son were placed under house arrest, where they lived under the threat of execution.</p><br>
<p>Escape from Agra

Undaunted, Shivaji feigned illness and, as a form of penance, began to send out enormous baskets filled with sweets to be distributed among the poor. On August 17, 1666, he and his son had themselves carried past their guards in these baskets. His escape, possibly the most thrilling episode in a life filled with high drama, was to change the course of Indian history.

Shivaji’s followers welcomed him back as their leader, and within two years he not only had won back all the lost territory but had expanded his domain. He collected tribute from Mughal regions and plundered their rich cities; he reorganized the army and instituted reforms for the welfare of his subjects. Taking a lesson from the Portuguese and English traders who had already gained toeholds in India, Shivaji also began building a naval force; he was the first Indian ruler of his time to use his sea power for trade as well as for defense.

Almost as though prodded by Shivaji’s meteoric rise, Aurangzeb intensified his persecution of Hindus: he imposed a poll tax on them, condoned forcible conversions, and demolished temples, erecting mosques in their places.</p>
